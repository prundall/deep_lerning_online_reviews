Deep Learning approach to sentiment analysis

This was my portion of a final project for one of my machine learning courses in graduate school. I trained and tested two Recursive Neural Networks (RNN). Both were Gated Recursive Units (GRU) models but in the second model I added concat pooling layers. 

There are two other files in this repository, the first is my portion of the final report, describing my models and their performance. The second is the Jupyter notebook for the models.
